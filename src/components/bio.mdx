Hi! I'm Gram and I love building things, from web to mobile to IoT.
I grew up in Cebu, Philippines where I attended the [Philippine Science High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Science_High_School_System).
I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) with a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
I was previously at Stripe where I worked on [Tap to Pay](https://stripe.com/terminal/tap-to-pay).
Today, I'm at [Decagon](https://decagon.ai/) in San Francisco ðŸŒ‰ building enterprise-grade AI agents for customer support.

<br />
I'm a big fan of technology and how it revolutionizes the way we tackle everything
from payments to education, consistently pushing the boundaries of what we think
is possible. I'm particularly interested in recent breakthroughs in AI and how 
they're set to change the way we build, create, and learn.
<br />
Outside of tech, I also love to cook! I try to do the food justice by honing the
art of food photography over on [@gram_cooks](https://www.instagram.com/gram_cooks/).
