Hi! I'm Gram and I love building things, from web to mobile to IoT.
I grew up in Cebu, Philippines where I attended the [Philippine Science High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Science_High_School_System).
I recently graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) with a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
Currently, I'm at Stripe in San Francisco ðŸŒ‰ building the future of in-person payments
with [Tap to Pay](https://stripe.com/terminal/tap-to-pay).

<br />
I'm a big fan of technology and how it revolutionizes the way we tackle everything
from payments to education, consistently pushing the boundaries of what we think
is possible. Most recently, I've been very excited about breakthroughs in the AI/LLM
space and I'm keen to see how this will change everything we know about our world
today.
<br />
Outside of tech, I also love to cook! I try to do the food justice by honing the
art of food photography over on [@gram_cooks](https://www.instagram.com/gram_cooks/).
