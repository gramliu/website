          A Chrome extension that embeds an AI personal teaching assistant next
          to educational YouTube videos. You can ask questions about the video
          in real-time, just like in a classroom. The AI assistant immediately
          has context about what has been discussed so far and provides answers
          with references to relevant timestamps in the video.

          We launched with the largest educational foundation in Sri Lanka. We
          created a DSL and runtime for rapidly prototyping and deploying LLM +
          retrieval pipelines and built around refining the ESL learning
          experience, which was the educational foundation&apos;s largest group
          of students. We addressed model hallucination for ESL through intent
          classification and augmentation with the Google Translate API.

        A tool that enables you to create low-fidelity mockups through a
        browser-based canvas and convert it into modular React components. It
        renders interactive previews that you can iterate on until you are
        satisfied before generating a PR with RSC-compatible components into
        your own linked GitHub repository.

        Journaling app where you take short audio notes throughout the day. It
        integrates with papers you&apos;ve read and past notes to provide
        AI-generated daily and weekly reflections. It additionally generates
        a knowledge graph to determine connections between entities you frequently
        talk about.
