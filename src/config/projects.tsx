        We built a platform to improve political literacy and accountability in
        the Philippines. We used the Google Cloud Vision SDK, Pegasus, and BERT
        to scan and summarize PDF bills from the Philippine Congress. We also
        scraped members of legislation and built profiles based on activity and
        semantic tags of authored bills.

        ScottyLabs and CMU SCS to create a space where students used this tool
        to design lighting sequences which were displayed on the bridge.
